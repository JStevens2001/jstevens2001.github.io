          <h2>What is Live-streaming?</h2>
          <p>Live streaming refers to online streaming media simultaneously
            recorded and broadcast in real time. It is often referred to simply
            as streaming, but this abbreviated term is ambiguous because "streaming"
            may refer to any media delivered and played back simultaneously
            without requiring a completely downloaded file. Non-live media such
            as video-on-demand, vlogs, and YouTube videos are technically streamed,
            but not live streamed.</p>
          <p>Live stream services encompass a wide variety of topics, from
            social media to video games to professional sports. Platforms such
            as Facebook Live, Periscope, Kuaishou, Douyu, bilibili and 17
            include the streaming of scheduled promotions and celebrity events
            as well as streaming between users, as in videotelephony. Sites
            such as Twitch have become popular outlets for watching people
            play video games, such as in esports, Let's Play-style gaming,
            or speedrunning. Live coverage of sporting events is a common
            application. </p>
          <p>User interaction via chat rooms forms a major component of live
            streaming. Platforms often include the ability to talk to the
            broadcaster or participate in conversations in chat. An extreme
            example of viewer interfacing is the social experiment Twitch Plays
            Pokémon, where viewers collaborate to complete Pokémon games by
            typing in commands that correspond to controller inputs. Many chat
            rooms also consists of emotes which is another way to communicate to
            the live streamer.</p>
