          <h2>Twitch</h2>
          <p>Twitch is a live streaming video platform owned by Twitch Interactive,
             a subsidiary of Amazon. Introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off
             of the general-interest streaming platform, Justin.tv, the site
             primarily focuses on video game live streaming, including broadcasts
             of eSports competitions, in addition to music broadcasts,
             creative content, and more recently, "in real life" streams.
             Content on the site can be viewed either live or via video on demand.</p>

          <h2>Youtube Live</h2>
          <p>YouTube was purchased by Google in 2006, and the pair subsequently
            announced their live streaming app. Like Periscope, users can comment
            on the broadcast. Unlike Periscope, live streams on YouTube can be
            saved and any user can access them through the app. YouTube head
            of product for consumers Manuel Bronstein stated that live streaming
            gives creators the opportunity to "actually create a more intimate
            connection with their fans."</p>

          <h2>Facebook Gaming</h2>
          <p>Facebook introduced a video streaming service, Facebook Gaming to
            select individuals in August 2016, and to the public in January 2017.
            Facebook watch is a video-on-demand service that allows users to
            share content live. It allows people to upload their videos that
            cover a wide array of topics including original comedy, drama, and
            news programming. Facebook Live allows Facebook users to include their
            own "reactions" when someone is broadcasting. One of the reasons that
            Facebook Gaming is so successful is because the content is recommended
            to users based on algorithms that determine what the user would most
            like to watch.</p>
